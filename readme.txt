The KIA Thematic Options Panel is a framework to help developers build options into their thematic child themes. 
It was forked from Thematic Theme Options by Devin Price: https://github.com/devinsays/thematic-options

To view a video demo of how it works and read Devin's original documentation, please visit: http://wptheming.com/thematic-options-panel 
Devin Price's Thematic Options Version 2.0 was completely recoded using WooThemes Canvas as a base (http://www.woothemes.com/2010/02/canvas/).  
The Thematic Options Panel is actually a slimmed down version of their version in Canvas, and I'd encourage you to check out and support WooThemes if you find this project helpful.
